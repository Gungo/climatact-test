# climatact-test
This is a simple test PHP source directory that shows basic functions and coding using PHP.


## Run the PHP Server
If you have PHP installed (as I did in macOS) you can run the following:

```php -S 127.0.0.1:8000```

This runs a simple php server within the current directory. 
This should automatically point to *index.php* when you visit `localhost:8000` or `127.0.0.1:8000` which is the same as localhost.

If you do not have PHP installed on your machine, install it and find a similar command to run a quick test server and checkout the barebones application.
